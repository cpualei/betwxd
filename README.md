### Application Architecture

Betwx'd is built with Flask (backend), React and Redux (frontend), and PostgresSQL (database).

<br>

### Future Features
âœ… To reflect the features Medium provides, I plan to implement a search function which allows writers to search other writers and articles, a "claps" feature which allows writers to "clap" (or like) a story, and profile pages for existing users where other users can view all stories that a particular writer has written.

âœ… Give users ability to edit their usernames

âœ… Give users ability to edit their bios

ðŸŸ© Give users ability to edit their profile pictures
