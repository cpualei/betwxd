        title='Onions CAN taste like apples',
        story='test story',
        # story='Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott currently has people scratching their heads as to what he was thinking when he ate a raw onion like most people would eat an apple. While people looking at Tony Abbott’s words and actions and thinking “what the hell are you doing?” is nothing unusual these days, this example has clearly struck a chord because it goes beyond short-sighted logic and patronising comments; it doesn’t matter what your political ideology or intellectual capabilities, onions are not the same as apples! It shouldn’t be possible to make this sort of mistake, or convince yourself otherwise. And yet, the Australian PM has done this. However, and this may be the first time this phrase has ever been used in a serious context, science backs up Tony Abbott. At least, to some extent. Firstly, taste, as enjoyable as it can be, is the weakest of the human senses. The five known types of taste, bitter, sweet, salt, sour and umami (the taste of savoury, triggered by glutamate) can provide a wide range of enjoyable and not-quite-so-enjoyable sensations, but the human nervous system doesn’t really do a lot with taste beyond judging food with it. There’s not much else it can do. It is not a particularly accurate or precise taste. Some may dispute this, citing established epicurists or expert wine tasters, the latter of whom can seemingly take a brief sip and name the region and year that the wine originates from, and even that the French vineyard worker who stomped the grapes had size 10 feet. But scientific experiments into this have revealed that the discipline of wine tasting is largely psychological. While nobody is accusing wine tasting experts of actively lying, it does seem like all the subtle differences in types of wine are built largely on expectation and guesswork, hence it varies so strongly between individuals. If taste were in any way reliable or accurate, this wouldn’t happen. So weak is taste, that it’s constantly dominated by other senses, most often vision and smell. You’ve probably heard is said that “the first bite is with the eye”? This isn’t some ruse created by restaurants to justify charging you 50 percent extra for a sprinkle or parsley or a shrivelled tomato, there is an actual scientific basis to this as how we visually perceive our food has a strong influence over how much we enjoy it. And anyone who’s had a nasty head cold will certainly be able to confirm that smell and taste are quite obviously linked; an inability to smell our food seriously impacts on our ability to taste it. To exactly what extent the other senses influence taste is still being studied, but there are many basic experiments available for you to test this. Basic plugging of the nose seemingly makes it very difficult to differentiate between apples, potatoes and onions. Others disagree with this because onions have a rather different texture to apples, incorporating a more physical factor that allows you to tell between them. However, some experiments where subjects have been wearing nose plugs while blindfolded have shown that subjects find it very hard to tell onions from apples. So basically, the fewer senses you have available, the harder it is to tell onions from apples. Overall, this shows that science says it is possible for people to mistake onions for apples, but only in certain circumstances. Basically, to ensure that this happens, someone has to be convinced in advance that they’re correct despite all available evidence, and be totally unable to accept any information that would suggest they are wrong. Tony Abbott can eat onions like they’re apples. Draw your own conclusions from this.',

        story='test story',
        # story="While they can seem pointless and purely irritating to us humans, mosquitoes do play a substantial role in the ecosystem. Mosquitoes form an important source of biomass in the food chain—serving as food for fish as larvae and for birds, bats and frogs as adult flies—and some species are important pollinators. Mosquitoes don’t deserve such a bad rap, says Yvonne-Marie Linton, research director at the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit, which curates Smithsonian’s U.S. National Mosquito Collection. Out of the more than 3,500 mosquito species, only around 400 can transmit diseases like malaria and West Nile virus to people, and most don’t feed on humans at all.",

        title='7 Facts About Elephants and Why They Don’t Belong in Captivity',
        story='test story',
        # story="It’s true! While most people assume there are only two—Asian and African—there are actually three: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Forest elephants are smaller than bush elephants at about half the size and their tusks are straighter and downward pointing while African bush elephants have more curved tusks. Both evolved from a common ancestor and have distinctly different DNA. One of the things I learned in grade school is that one of the easiest ways to tell a species of elephant apart is from the shape of their ears. Both forest and bush African elephants have ears resembling the geometry of Africa while Asian elephants have ears that resemble the geometric shape of continental Asia. Asian elephants have significantly smaller ears than their African counterparts. The African elephants species can reach a staggering 13 feet tall at shoulder height. To put it in perspective, Asian elephants can reach about 10 feet tall and are a minimum height of 6.8 feet. In relation to humans, the tallest man on record is Sultan Kösen who grew to be 8 foot, 2 inches. African elephants are just about twice the size of Michael Jordan! As Asian elephant populations decrease (they’re listed as endangered by IUCN), the numbers of elephants in captivity continue to rise for various exploitative industries. In the US, Asian elephants have been used in circuses like the now defunct Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, Cole Bros. Circus, and Shiners (which still continues to travel and perform). In Thailand, these elephants are being used for riding, bathing, for selfies, and in the logging industry. World Animal Protection is working to end elephant entertainment through legislation in the US and by transforming commercial Thai venues to stop all direct contact interactions. Nearly 35,000 African elephants are poached for their tusks each year for traditional Chinese medicine. While Asian elephants are still poached for their tusks, all species are at risk for poaching due to demand for their skin, which is fashioned into jewelry. Conservation organizations estimate nearly 100 elephants are poached each day. Most tuskers are male, with the largest tusks being targeted for the most ivory. However, most recently tuskers have been found with smaller tusks either as a protective evolutionary trait or because larger males have been poached out of the gene pool. Elephants in the wild have one of the largest home ranges, often walking up to 40 miles each day. In captivity, whether it’s a circus, zoo, or other commercial venue, captivity can not nearly replicate their natural environment. Unlike dogs and cats, working alongside, breeding, and interacting with elephants has not changed their behaviors and they remain wild (undomesticated). This means that trainers have to implement painful and traumatizing techniques, such as “the crush” to force the captive elephants to obey. One of the most important things we can do to protect elephants is to refuse to participate in activities where direct contact of wild animals takes place. Bathing, riding, feeding, or simply touching an elephant means that the animal had to endure being torn from its mother’s side, tied down, and beaten with sharp weapons called a bullhook in order to make it submit to human interaction. We can also take action by reporting illegal ivory sold in shops where there is a ban in place to the proper authorities, decreasing the social acceptance of ivory, and working to protect their natural habitats.",
